        <h1> Our Mission </h1>
        <p> 
        The average cost of college per student lies at a whopping $35,000 per year. This is more than half of the national average salary of $53,490. With high demands pushing the inflation up to 10.8% in foods between 4/2021-4/2022, food insecurity is only becoming more prevalent among college students.
        </p>

        <p>
        Food insecurity is seen as a range of spectrum in the model below.Food insecurity also is associated with a broad range of psychological difficulties, including depression, stress, and anxiety.

        <h1> Lasting Effects of Food Insecurity</h1>

        <p> 
            While studies confirm that food insecurity is linked to lower GPAs and lower academic performance, food-insecure college students are more likely to develop serious mental health issues". 
            Mild to moderate psychological distress was higher among those who reported to being food insecure, in addition to ~60% of students feeling overwhelmed by schooling. 
            This leads to an increase in anxiety and depression, lower GPA and academic performance, significantly higher dropout rates and increased debt.
